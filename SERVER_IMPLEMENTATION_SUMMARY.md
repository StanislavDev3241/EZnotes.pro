## 🚧 What Still Needs to be Done

### 1. Dependencies Installation

```bash
# The npm install command failed due to network issues
# Need to install these packages:
npm install express multer cors helmet morgan dotenv pg redis bull jsonwebtoken bcryptjs express-rate-limit express-validator fs-extra
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# PostgreSQL database and user creation
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE clearlyai_db;
CREATE USER clearlyai_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE clearlyai_db TO clearlyai_user;
\q
```

### 3. Redis Setup

```bash
# Redis installation and configuration
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy and configure environment file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

### 5. Frontend Integration

- Update frontend to use new server endpoints instead of direct Make.com calls
- Implement authentication flow
- Update file upload to use new server
- Handle authentication tokens and user sessions

## 🔄 How the New System Works

### 1. File Upload Flow

```
User Upload → Server → Database → Queue → Make.com → Server → Database → User
```

1. **User uploads file** to `/api/upload`
2. **Server stores file** and creates database records
3. **File processing job** is added to queue
4. **Server sends file URL** to Make.com webhook
5. **Make.com processes file** and sends notes back to `/api/notes/webhook`
6. **Server stores notes** and updates file status
7. **User can access notes** through `/api/notes/user`

### 2. Admin Access Flow

```
Admin Login → Dashboard → View All Notes → Download/Manage → System Monitoring
```

1. **Admin logs in** with credentials
2. **Access dashboard** with all files and notes
3. **View statistics** and system health
4. **Download notes** individually or in bulk
5. **Monitor queues** and job status
6. **Manage retention** and cleanup

### 3. Queue Management

```
File Upload → Processing Queue → Status Updates → Completion/Failure
```

1. **Jobs are queued** with priority and retry logic
2. **Workers process jobs** and update progress
3. **Database status** is updated in real-time
4. **Failed jobs** can be retried or removed
5. **Queue monitoring** provides real-time insights

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Running

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd clearlyai-server
npm install
```

### 2. Setup Database and Redis

```bash
# Follow the deployment script or manual setup
./deploy.sh your-domain.com
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Edit .env file with your actual values
nano .env
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

### 5. Test the System

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test admin login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@clearlyai.com","password":"admin_secure_password"}'
```
